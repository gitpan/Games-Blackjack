TODO:
      * There's currently a bug in Quantum::Superpositions 2.02, which is 
        used by Games::Blackjack internally. It's being investigated by
        Q::S maintainer Steven Lembark <lembark@wrkhors.com>, I'll keep 
        you up to date.
      * Add doubling/splitting of hands

I know about it, working on a patch. Basic problem is that
the iterator logic needs to bless the returned items and
it isn't. Issue is to make sure that they are blessed at
the proper level and handled correctly by Multimethods.

For the moment you can try applying the attached, warn me
if it works properly.
